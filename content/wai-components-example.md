Illustration with labeled graphics of boxes, content, and people. at the top center is a pie chart, an image, a form, and text, labeled “content”. coming up from the bottom left, a line connects “developers” through “authoring tools” and “evaluation tools” to “content” at the top. coming up from the bottom right, a line connects “users” to “browsers, media players” and “assistive technologies” to “content” at the top.
